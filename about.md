Hey, foreigner! Welcome to my home page on internet.

My name is Raphael - aka Peaga. I'm not sure about what I'm writing about yet, but for sure it will be relevant topics to me - be it about software development, life or reflections. Also, I want to keep track of interesting topics I see around and notes to self, so I thought a blog would be a nice place to keep them.

If you find anything relevant to you in here, drop me a line on [Twitter][@peagasilva]{:target="blank"} if you like.

Ready or not, here I go! ðŸ¤“
