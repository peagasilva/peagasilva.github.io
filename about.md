Hello, stranger! Welcome to my home page.

My name is Raphael, aka Peaga. I'm not sure what I'll be writing about here but the majority of topics will be regarding to software development, life or even reflections. I also want to register some interesting matters and notes to self, making a blog a good place you can find nice stuff.

If you find here something relevant, feel free to [tweet me][@peagasilva]{:target="blank"} and share your thoughts!

Ready or not, here I go! ðŸ¤“
